# Homework #4

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Callback Functions = callback functions can be passed to other functions as parameters. This is also known as a callback pattern. It is especially useful if your code uses the same calculations or conversions within other, different functions.
	* Closure = a closure is an inner function that has access to the outer function's scope. This is especially useful if your function needs to solve something through recursion like a fibonacci sequence.
	* `arguments`= the arguments array contains all arguments passed to a function. However, it is not actually an array. It is an object that is similar to an array in that its properties are numbered like an array.

	* Recursion = recursion is the ability to call a function from within itself.


	* `prototype`= a prototype property allows you to attach properties and methods to an object, i.e. when you want to create a constructor.
	* Constructors = constructors are essentially custom objects that we can create when we plan to be able to create multiple instances of a certain type of object.


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* `git status`
	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
	* `git push origin master`

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
